# Arduino autonomous car project

This project implements an autonomous car using Arduino, designed to navigate through obstacles and follow predefined paths without manual control. The car uses sensors for real-time environment detection and decision-making to drive safely and efficiently.

### Features
* Obstacle detection and avoidance using ultrasonic sensors

* Line following capability with infrared sensors

Motor control for steering and speed management

Modular Arduino code for easy customization and expansion

* Real-time feedback via serial monitor

### Hardware Components
* Arduino Uno (or compatible board)

* Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)

* Infrared line sensors

* DC motors with motor driver (L298N)

* Chassis with wheels and power supply

* Jumper wires, breadboard, and mounting hardware

### Software
* Arduino IDE for programming

* Code structured into sensor reading, decision logic, and motor control modules

* Comments included for ease of understanding and modification
